			<header>How CSS works</header>
			<p>We have learned the basics of CSS, what it is for and how to
				write simple stylesheets. In this lesson we will take a look at how
				a browser takes CSS and HTML and turns that into a webpage.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="main-section" id="How_does_CSS_actually_work?">
			<header>How does CSS actually work?</header>
			<p>When a browser displays a document, it must combine the
				document's content with its style information. It processes the
				document in a number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in
				mind that this is a very simplified version of what happens when a
				browser loads a webpage, and that different browsers will handle the
				process in different ways. But this is roughly what happens.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the
					network).</li>
				<li>It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model).
					The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. The DOM
					is explained in a bit more detail in the next section.</li>
				<li>The browser then fetches most of the resources that are
					linked to by the HTML document, such as embedded images and videos
					... and linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the
					process, and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.</li>
				<li>The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different
					rules by their selector types into different "buckets", e.g.
					element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it
					works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM,
					and attaches style to them as required (this intermediate step is
					called a render tree).</li>
				<li>The render tree is laid out in the structure it should
					appear in after the rules have been applied to it.</li>
				<li>The visual display of the page is shown on the screen (this
					stage is called painting).</li>
			</ol>
		</section>
		<section class="main-section" id="About_the_DOM">
			<header>About the DOM</header>
			<p>A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute, and
				piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree
				structure. The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM
				nodes. Some elements are parents of child nodes, and child nodes
				have siblings.</p>
			<p>Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain
				your CSS because the DOM is where your CSS and the document's
				content meet up. When you start working with browser DevTools you
				will be navigating the DOM as you select items in order to see which
				rules apply.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="main-section" id="A_real_DOM_representation">
			<header>A real DOM representation</header>
			<p>Rather than a long, boring explanation, let's look at an
				example to see how a real HTML snippet is converted into a DOM.</p>
			<p>Take the following HTML code:</p>
			<pre>
<code>
&ltp&gt
  Let's use:
  &ltspan&gtCascading&lt/span&gt
  &ltspan&gtStyle&lt/span&gt
  &ltspan&gtSheets&lt/span&gt
&lt/p&gt
</code>
</pre>
			<p>In the DOM, the node corresponding to our &ltp&gt element is a
				parent. Its children are a text node and the three nodes
				corresponding to our &ltspan&gt elements. The SPAN nodes are also
				parents, with text nodes as their children:</p>
		</section>
		<p>This is how a browser interprets the previous HTML snippet —it
			renders the above DOM tree and then outputs it in the browser like
			so:</p>

		<section class="main-section" id="Applying_CSS_to_the_DOM">
			<header>Applying CSS to the DOM</header>
			<p>Let's say we added some CSS to our document, to style it.
				Again, the HTML is as follows:</p>
			<pre>
<code>
&ltp&gt
  Let's use:
  &ltspan&gtCascading&lt/span&gt
  &ltspan&gtStyle&lt/span&gt
  &ltspan&gtSheets&lt/span&gt
&lt/p&gt
</code>
</pre>
			<p>Let's suppose we apply the following CSS to it:</p>
			<pre>
<code>
span {
  border: 1px solid black;
  background-color: lime;
}
</code>
</pre>
			<p>The browser will parse the HTML and create a DOM from it, then
				parse the CSS. Since the only rule available in the CSS has a span
				selector, the browser will be able to sort the CSS very quickly! It
				will apply that rule to each one of the three span s, then paint the
				final visual representation to the screen.</p>
		</section>
		<p>The updated output is as follows:</p>
		<pre>
<code>
Let's use: Cascading Style Sheets
</code>
</pre>
		<p>In our Debugging CSS article in the next module we will be
			using browser DevTools to debug CSS problems, and will learn more
			about how the browser interprets CSS.</p>

		<section class="main-section"
			id="What_happens_if_a_browser_encounters_CSS_it_doesn't_understand?">
			<header>What happens if a browser encounters CSS it doesn't
				understand?</header>
			<p>In an earlier lesson I mentioned that browsers do not all
				implement new CSS at the same time. In addition, many people are not
				using the latest version of a browser. Given that CSS is being
				developed all the time, and is therefore ahead of what browsers can
				recognize, you might wonder what happens if a browser encounters a
				CSS selector or declaration it doesn't recognize. The answer is that
				it does nothing, and just moves on to the next bit of CSS! If a
				browser is parsing your rules, and encounters a property or value
				that it doesn't understand, it ignores it and moves on to the next
				declaration. It will do this if you have made an error and
				misspelled a property or value, or if the property or value is just
				too new and the browser doesn't yet support it. Similarly, if a
				browser encounters a selector that it doesn't understand, it will
				just ignore the whole rule and move on to the next one. In the
				example below I have used the British English spelling for color,
				which makes that property invalid as it is not recognized. So my
				paragraph has not been colored blue. All of the other CSS have been
				applied however; only the invalid line is ignored.</p>
			<pre>
<code>
&ltp&gtI want this text to be large, bold and blue.&lt/p&gt
</code>
</pre>
			<pre>
<code>
p {
  font-weight: bold;
  colour: blue; /* incorrect spelling of the color property */
  font-size: 200%;
}
</code>
</pre>
			<pre>
<code>
I want this text to be large, bold and blue.
</code>
</pre>
			<p>This behavior is very useful. It means that you can use new
				CSS as an enhancement, knowing that no error will occur if it is not
				understood — the browser will either get the new feature or not.
				This enables basic fallback styling.</p>
			<p>This works particularly well when you want to use a value that
				is quite new and not supported everywhere. For example, some older
				browsers do not support calc() as a value. I might give a fallback
				width for a box in pixels, then go on to give a width with a calc()
				value of 100% - 50px. Old browsers will use the pixel version,
				ignoring the line about calc() as they don't understand it. New
				browsers will interpret the line using pixels, but then override it
				with the line using calc() as that line appears later in the
				cascade.</p>
			<pre>
<code>
.box {
  width: 500px;
  width: calc(100% - 50px);
}
</code>
</pre>

			<p>We will look at many more ways to support varying browsers in
				later lessons.</p>
